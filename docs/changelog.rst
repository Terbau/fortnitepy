Changelog
=========

Detailed version changes.


v3.6.8
------

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed an issue that caused accounts that had not yet registered date of birth to not be able to login.

- :attr:`UserSearchPlatform.STEAM`


v3.6.4
------

Bug fixes

------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a critical crash issue introduced in v3.6.0.


v3.6.0
------

Changes
~~~~~~~

- (**Breaking**) Party member meta change events like :func:`event_party_member_outfit_change()` are no longer emitted by the initial meta update that is received when a member joins the party.
- (**Breaking**) The "other" argument in :func:`event_party_member_team_swap()` can now be ``None`` if the member swapped to an empty position.

Added
~~~~~

- (**Breaking**) Added :exc:`PartyIsFull` exception which is now raised by :class:`Client.join_party()`.
- Added functionality related to the new "Request to join" feature.
  - Added :meth:`Friend.request_to_join()`. Read the warning field in the docs before using it.
  - Added :func:`event_party_join_request()`.
- Completely reworked party squad assignments and added functionality related to it.
  - Added the following kwargs to :class:`DefaultPartyConfig`:
    - ``default_squad_assignment``
    - ``position_priorities``
    - ``reassign_positions_on_size_change``
  - Added :meth:`ClientPartyMember.set_position()`.
  - Added :meth:`ClientParty.set_squad_assignments()`. This can be used to "hide" certain members and also change their positions.
  - Added :attr:`ClientParty.squad_assignments`.
  - Added :attr:`PartyMember.hidden`.
- Added kwarg ``wait_for_member_meta_in_events`` to :class:`Client`. It is ``True`` by default which introduces a ~1 sec delay to :func:`event_party_member_join()`.
- Added :meth:`Friend.owns_offer()` which can be used to check if a friend owns an offer currently in the item-shop.
- Added timestamps for season 16.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed a relatively hidden bug in :meth:`PartyMember.swap_position()`.

Misc
~~~~

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Bumped aioxmpp compatibility requirement to the latest version (``0.12.0``)

- Added :meth:`User.fetch()` (applies to all objects derived from ``UserBase`` too) which can be used to refetch userdata like display name and external auths. This is useful if you have the new kwarg set to ``False``.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed several bugs related to changes in python 3.9 that caused the version to be incompatible with fortnitepy.
- Fixed what I believe to be (hopefully) the last remaining issues that caused :attr:`ClientParty.me` to be ``None`` in some rare cases.

v0.9.0
------

| **BREAKING UPDATE**
| This update adds windows support for python 3.8, removes the need for setting a net_cl and fixes multiple important bugs.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :exc:`Forbidden` has been renamed from ``PartyPermissionError``.
- Reworked and added documentation for :meth:`Client.join_to_party()`. The function no longer takes ``party`` as a keyword and a new kwarg ``check_private`` has been added.

Changes
~~~~~~~

- You no longer need to worry about net_cl, ever.
- Added :func:`get_event_loop()` to get a working event loop on Windows. It isn't necessary to use this function as long as fortnitepy is imported before the event loop is created.
- Added :meth:`HTTPException.reraise()` which reraises the exception.
- Added :meth:`Friend.invite()` which invites the friend to your party.
- :meth:`ClientPartyMember.set_banner()` and :meth:`ClientParty.set_playlist()`
- The loading time between accepting and joining a party with 2+ users has been significantly decreased.
- :meth:`PartyInvitation.accept()` now raises :exc:`Forbidden` if you attempted to join a private party you have already been a member of before.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed multiple internal issues related to party chat.
- Fixed an issue where that caused invites sent by the client to its private party to not work.
- Fixed an issue where :func:`event_party_member_join()` would dispatch before party chat was ready.
- Fixed an issue that caused aioxmpp logger to not work.


v0.8.0
------

| **BREAKING UPDATE**
| This update reworks and adds a couple of stats functions, adds some new features that came with Fortnite 2 season 1 and fixes some important bugs.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Most functions with keyword arguments now uses strict kwargs. This means you must specify the argument as a keyword. If you've used keyword arguments correctly before, this will not be an issue.
- The new correct way to get stats from the object :class:`StatsV2` is now with the :meth:`StatsV2.get_stats()` method. Up until this version the way to get the stats from the object was to call ``StatsV2.stats``.
- :meth:`Client.fetch_br_stats()` now returns ``None`` if the user was not found. An empty :class:`StatsV2` is still returned if a valid user doesn't have any recorded stats.
- :meth:`Client.fetch_multiple_br_stats()` now returns ``None`` mapped to the passed userid if the user was not found. An empty :class:`StatsV2` is still returned if a valid user doesn't have any recorded stats for the stats you requested.
- The cache keyword argument in :meth:`Client.fetch_profile`, :meth:`Client.fetch_profiles` and :meth:`Client.fetch_profile_by_display_name` now defaults to ``False`` which means the client will not attempt to get any of the requested users from the cache.
- :attr:`Playlist.violator` was renamed from `violater` because of the typo.
- :attr:`PresenceGameplayStats.players_alive` was moved from :class:`Presence` to :class:`PresenceGameplayStats`.

Added
~~~~~

- Added a new event :func:`event_friend_request_abort` which emits when a sent friend request is aborted before the receiving user has accepted it.
- Added :meth:`Client.update_net_cl()` which updated the current net_cl and party_build_id while the client is running.
- Added :meth:`Client.fetch_multiple_battleapss_levels` which fetches multiple userids battlepass levels at once.
- Added :meth:`Client.fetch_battlepass_level` which fetches a userid's battlepass level.
- You can now pass ``None`` to :meth:`ClientPartyMember.set_ready()` to make the client go into the Sitting Out state.
- Added :attr:`PartyInvitation.net_cl` which returns the net_cl that was sent with a party invitation.
- Added :attr:`Presence.avatar` to get the cid of the friends Kairos avatar.
- Added :attr:`Presence.avatar_colors` to get the background colors of the friends Kairos avatar.
- Added :meth:`StatsV2.get_stats()` which is now the correct approach to getting the users stats mapped to platforms and gamemodes from the object. 
- Added :meth:`StatsV2.get_combined_stats()` to get the users combined stats mapped to platforms. There is also an option to combine stats across all platforms.
- Added :meth:`User.fetch_br_stats()` to get a users stats directly from the object. (Function exists for :class:`Friend` too since it inherits from :class:`User`)
- Added :meth:`User.fetch_battlepass_levels()` to get a users battlepass level directly from the object. (Function exists for :class:`Friend` too since it inherits from :class:`User`)
- Updated net_cl and build info.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- :attr:`StatsV2.start_time` and :attr:`StatsV2.end_time` now actually works.
- Removed the new stat ``s11_social_bp_level`` from :class:`StatsV2`.
- Moved the check invalid net_cl check to method :meth:`PartyInvitation.accept()` so it is possible to catch the exception.
- Renamed :attr:`Playlist.violator` from ``violater`` because of the typo.
- Waiting for the 2fa code to be entered into console is no longer blocking.
- :class:`Playlist` now uses __slots__ to reduce its memory footprint.
- Fixed another issue that lead to ``Incompatible net_cl`` being incorrectly raised.
- Attempted to fix `issue #38 <https://github.com/Terbau/fortnitepy/issues/38>`_.
- Fixed some issues in the docs.

- Added :attr:`PartyMember.backpack_variants` to get the raw backpack variants of this member.

Thanks to `amrsatrio <https://github.com/Amrsatrio>`_ and `Luc1412 <https://github.com/Luc1412>`_ for suggestions and help with this update.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added :meth:`Client.fetch_lightswitch_status` for checking Fortnite's status.
