API Reference
=============

.. _authentication:

Authentication
--------------

As of v1.4.0, you now have to specify which authentication method you want to 
use for login. The one used up until this version was :class:`EmailAndPasswordAuth`. However,
after that authentication method recently has started to require captcha to login in quite a lot
of cases, this is no longer the preferred method in the long run.

The preferred method in the long run is now :class:`DeviceAuth`. To set up and handle this type
of auth, you should use :class:`AdvancedAuth`. `This example <https://github.com/Terbau/fortnitepy/blob/master/examples/basic_client.py>`_ demonstrates
how you can set up this auth with file storage for the preferred login which is :class:`DeviceAuth`.

Event Reference
---------------

Events can be registered by the ``@client.event`` decorator. You do not need 
this decorator if you are in a subclass of :class:`Client`.

.. warning::

    All events must be registered as coroutines!

.. function:: event_ready()

	This event is called when the client .has been successfully established and connected to all services.

	This event is called and waited for before the client starts.

	.. warning::
	
		This event is not called when the client starts in :class:`Client.restart()`.

	.. note::

		This event behaves differently from the other events. The client will wait until the event handlers for this event is finished processing before actually closing. This makes it so you are able to do heavy and/or time consuming operations before the client fully logs out. This unfortunately also means that this event is not compatible with :meth:`Client.wait_for()`.

.. function:: event_before_close()

	This event is called when the client is beginning to log out. This event also exists under the name ``event_close()`` for legacy reasons.

	.. warning::

        This event is not called when the client logs out in :class:`Client.restart()`.

	.. note::

Stats Reference
---------------

Gamemode names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since stats received from Fortnite's services changes all the time by adding 
new gamemodes and such, none of the gamemode names have been changed from the 
original response gotten from the request. Therefore, if you want to access a 
users solo stats, you must use the internal name for the solo gamemode:
``defaultsolo``.

There is no good, easy way of retrieving all these internal names. So for now
the best way you can do this is by fetching stats from someone that has played
a lot of different gamemode e.g. the user ``Dark`` (more known as Dakotaz) and
just write the gamemode names down.
